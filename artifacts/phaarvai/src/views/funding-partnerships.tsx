              <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Many consequential technology programs receive funding — then fail in execution. Not because the vision was wrong, but because the technical architecture was never designed to support the compliance and scale that funding mandates require.
              </p>
              <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                Funding bodies are increasingly sophisticated. Weak technical execution is a primary reason programs lose funding after the first cycle. We de-risk execution before capital is deployed.
